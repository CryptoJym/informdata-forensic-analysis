# InformData API Discrepancy Verification Plan - Ultra Think

## The Challenge

We need to verify every single claimed discrepancy between InformData's official API documentation and Vuplicity's implementation with 100% accuracy. No hallucinations, no assumptions - only verified facts with clickable references.

## Key Requirements

1. **100% Verification**: Every claim must be backed by actual evidence from files
2. **Clickable References**: Each discrepancy must link to exact line numbers in actual files
3. **Visual Flow Diagrams**: Show how PRDs would transform each repository
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Explain why inconsistencies exist (if determinable)
5. **Clear Comparison**: Consistent solution vs inconsistent implementation

## Virtual Engineering Team Structure

### Team 1: Documentation Forensics (3 Engineers)
- **Engineer 1A**: Official API Documentation Analyzer
  - Verify official InformData API requirements
  - Extract exact field naming conventions
  - Document authentication methods
  - Create reference table of all official endpoints
  
- **Engineer 1B**: Implementation Scanner
  - Scan all Vuplicity repositories for InformData integrations
  - Map actual implementations vs documentation
  - Identify exact file locations and line numbers
  
- **Engineer 1C**: Discrepancy Validator
  - Cross-reference findings from 1A and 1B
  - Validate each discrepancy with evidence
  - Create verification matrix

### Team 2: Evidence Collection (4 Engineers)
- **Engineer 2A**: Field Naming Evidence Collector
  - Document all instances of firstName vs FirstName
  - Create clickable evidence map
  - Verify in test files, implementation files, and documentation
  
- **Engineer 2B**: Product Structure Evidence Collector
  - Document product-specific field requirements
  - Map criminal vs employment vs education structures
  - Verify against actual API calls
  
- **Engineer 2C**: Authentication Evidence Collector
  - Verify GET vs POST for authentication
  - Document JWT token handling
  - Map authentication flow discrepancies
  
- **Engineer 2D**: Response Format Evidence Collector
  - Document verification triple pattern
  - Map response structure discrepancies
  - Verify webhook payload formats

### Team 3: Visual Documentation (3 Engineers)
- **Engineer 3A**: Repository Impact Visualizer
  - Create flow diagrams for each repository
  - Show before/after states with PRD implementation
  - Map dependency chains
  
- **Engineer 3B**: Data Flow Visualizer
  - Create visual representation of current inconsistent flow
  - Design consistent flow with corrections
  - Show impact on each system component
  
- **Engineer 3C**: Interactive Dashboard Creator
  - Build clickable evidence dashboard
  - Create drill-down capability for each discrepancy
  - Implement live code comparison views

### Team 4: Root Cause Analysis (2 Engineers)
- **Engineer 4A**: Historical Analysis
  - Investigate git history for pattern changes
  - Document developer decision points
  - Map confusion sources
  
- **Engineer 4B**: Systematic Issues Documenter
  - Identify patterns in inconsistencies
  - Document cascading effects
  - Create prevention recommendations

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Evidence Gathering (Teams 1 & 2)
1. Scan all repositories for InformData references
2. Extract official documentation requirements
3. Map every implementation against documentation
4. Create evidence database with file paths and line numbers

### Phase 2: Verification (All Teams)
1. Cross-reference all findings
2. Validate each discrepancy with multiple sources
3. Remove any unverifiable claims
4. Create verification certificates for each finding

### Phase 3: Documentation Creation (Teams 3 & 4)
1. Build interactive HTML documentation
2. Create visual flow diagrams
3. Implement clickable reference system
4. Document root causes where determinable

### Phase 4: Final Verification
1. Peer review all findings
2. Test all clickable references
3. Validate visual representations
4. Create executive summary

## Deliverables

1. **Verified Discrepancy Database**
   - Each discrepancy with evidence
   - File paths and line numbers
   - Clickable references
   
2. **Interactive HTML Documentation**
   - Drill-down capability
   - Side-by-side comparisons
   - Live code views
   
3. **Visual Flow Diagrams**
   - Current inconsistent state
   - Proposed consistent state
   - Repository impact maps
   
4. **Root Cause Analysis Report**
   - Why inconsistencies exist
   - Developer decision points
   - Prevention recommendations

## Success Criteria

1. Zero unverified claims
2. 100% clickable reference coverage
3. Clear visual representation of impacts
4. Actionable implementation plan for each repository
5. No trust required - everything is verifiable
